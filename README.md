# 🪐 Outer Wilds Ship Log Canvas

**A vibe-coded knowledge graph for your chaotic ideas.**

> Ever since I played **Outer Wilds**, I've been obsessed with the *Ship Log*. I searched everywhere for a note-taking tool that captured that specific feeling, but I never found one. So, I decided to **vibe code one myself :)**

### 🚀 What is this?

It's a canvas where you drop "signals" (cards) and connect them with "rumors" (arrows). It's built to feel like you're piecing together a mystery on a rusty spaceship.

### ✨ The Cool Stuff

* **Rumor Mode:** No fiddling with tiny drag-handles. Just click "Link," click two cards, and watch the arrow appear. It feels like Nomai tech.
* **The Log Panel:** Each card is a full Markdown editor. Write theories, paste image URLs, and choose thematic colors (Probe Green, Bramble Red, etc).
* **Yours Forever:** No accounts. No cloud. Export to JSON, keep it on your drive, import it when you're ready to explore again.
